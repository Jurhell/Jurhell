# About Me
I'm Jurhell Hughes, a Unity and Unreal programmer. My main programming languages are C# and C++, I have 2 years of experience working in a studio environment and am familiar with the game development pipeline. So far I have helped create and ship three projects with a small team at AIE with my latest project being an Unreal Engine 5 game called Escape Velocity. I'm eager to work on more games to sharpen my skills become a better game developer.

Garden A-Salt is a Unity VR game created with the aide of HurricaneVR. Garden A-Salt was another student project made at AIE with a full development cycle. The game is a wave shooter where the player would use a salt gun and a few salt shaker grenades to fight off waves of attacking snails. My responsibilities were AI programming for the snails, handling the functionality for grenades, spawning for both the grenades and snails, the player damage functionality and triggering the game's end state on player death, and also the overall game loop.
