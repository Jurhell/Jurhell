LooterLand is a top down 2.5D game created in Unity. LooterLand was student project mad at AIE with a full development cycle from planning to post-production. With a team made up of three programmmers and eight artists. My responsibilites on this project were AI programming, UI and Menu programming, along with the game's end state.
